# Project 2 - Flixster

Flixster is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: 16 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [X] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [X] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [X] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [X] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [X] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView. //Both are shown
- [ ] User can search for a movie.
- [ ] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [ ] User can view the large movie poster by tapping on a cell.
- [ ] For the large poster, load the low resolution image first and then switch to the high resolution image when complete.
- [ ] Customize the selection effect of the cell.
- [ ] Customize the navigation bar.
- [ ] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Added 5 stars for users to rate their favorite movies
- [X] Changed color, size, design and font of the app
- [X] Added labels such as "Print your favorite posters" to make the App more creative

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I would like a better explanation of how to incorporate a search tab.
2. I would like to discuss how to better link view controllers

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

1. Time was the most challenging part of the assignment; I wish I had more time to better understand each component in order to be able to add more of the optional features.

2. Toggling issues were recurrent.
